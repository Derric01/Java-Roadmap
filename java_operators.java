Java Operators
Java Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

ExampleGet your own Java Server
int x = 100 + 50;

Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:

Example
int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)

Java divides the operators into the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Bitwise operators
Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

Operator	Name	Description	Example	Try it
+	Addition	Adds together two values	x + y	
-	Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another	x - y	
*	Multiplication	Multiplies two values	x * y	
/	Division	Divides one value by another	x / y	
%	Modulus	Returns the division remainder	x % y	
++	Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
--	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x	
Java Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x:

Example
int x = 10;

The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:

Example
int x = 10;
x += 5;

A list of all assignment operators:

Operator	Example	Same As	Try it
=	x = 5	x = 5	
+=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
&=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3	
Java Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

The return value of a comparison is either true or false. These values are known as Boolean values, and you will learn more about them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.

In the following example, we use the greater than operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:

Example
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
System.out.println(x > y); // returns true, because 5 is higher than 3

Operator	Name	Example	Try it
==	Equal to	x == y	
!=	Not equal	x != y	
>	Greater than	x > y	
<	Less than	x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y	
Java Logical Operators
You can also test for true or false values with logical operators.

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:

Operator	Name	Description	Example	Try it
&& 	Logical and	Returns true if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10	
|| 	Logical or	Returns true if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4	
!	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	!(x < 5 && x < 10)
