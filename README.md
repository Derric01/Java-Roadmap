# Java Learning Roadmap

## Stage 1: Java Basics (1-2 weeks)
**Objective**: Get comfortable with the basic syntax and structure of Java.
- **Introduction to Java**: Installing JDK, setting up IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VS Code)
- **Variables & Data Types**: `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, `String`
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment
- **Control Flow**: `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`, `do-while`
- **Functions/Methods**: Defining and calling functions, passing arguments, `return` statement
- **Basic I/O**: `Scanner`, `System.out.println()`

### Example:
java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
}

Stage 2: Object-Oriented Programming (2-3 weeks)

Objective: Master the fundamentals of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts in Java.

    Classes & Objects: Creating classes, constructors, creating objects
    Methods: Instance methods, class methods, method overloading
    Encapsulation: Using private, public, and protected for data hiding
    Inheritance: Extending classes, method overriding
    Polymorphism: Dynamic method dispatch, method overloading/overriding
    Abstraction: Abstract classes and methods, interfaces
    Access Modifiers: private, public, protected, default

Example: Class and Object

java

class Car {
    String model;
    int year;

    public Car(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Car model: " + model + ", Year: " + year);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Tesla", 2021);
        myCar.display();
    }
}

Stage 3: Advanced Java Concepts (2-3 weeks)

Objective: Deep dive into more advanced Java features.

    Arrays & Collections:
        Arrays: Declaration, initialization, multi-dimensional arrays
        ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet: Working with collections in Java
        Generics: Type-safe collections
    Exception Handling: try-catch, throw, throws, custom exceptions
    Java Standard Library: Understanding useful classes (e.g., String, Math, Date, Scanner)
    Lambda Expressions & Functional Interfaces: Using Runnable, Consumer, Function
    Streams: Stream API for functional-style operations on collections

Example: Exception Handling

java

try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
    System.out.println("This will always run.");
}

Stage 4: Java Advanced Topics (3-4 weeks)

Objective: Master the advanced Java topics used in real-world applications.

    Multithreading: Creating threads, Runnable, synchronization
    File I/O: Reading and writing files using FileReader, BufferedReader, FileWriter, BufferedWriter
    Networking: Sockets, Client-Server communication, RESTful services (with HttpURLConnection)
    Java Memory Management: Stack vs Heap, garbage collection
    Design Patterns: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, Decorator, etc.
    Java 8+ Features: Streams, Optional, CompletableFuture, DateTime API

Example: Multithreading

java

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();
    }
}

Stage 5: Java Frameworks & Libraries (4-6 weeks)

Objective: Learn popular Java frameworks and libraries used in web and enterprise applications.

    Spring Framework:
        Spring Boot: Rapid development for Java web apps
        Spring MVC: Model-View-Controller design pattern
        Spring Data JPA: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) with databases
        Spring Security: Authentication and Authorization
    Hibernate: ORM framework for database interaction
    JavaFX: Building desktop GUI applications
    JUnit: Unit testing Java applications

Stage 6: Java for Web Development (4-6 weeks)

Objective: Learn how to build web applications in Java.

    Servlets & JSP: Java-based web technologies for dynamic content
    RESTful APIs with Spring Boot: Building and consuming RESTful APIs
    Database Interaction: Using JDBC, MySQL/PostgreSQL, and JPA/Hibernate for database operations
    Building Full-stack Apps: Backend with Spring Boot, frontend with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, integrating with databases

Stage 7: Practice & Projects (Ongoing)

Objective: Strengthen your skills by working on real-world projects.

    Mini Projects:
        Calculator
        Banking System
        Employee Management System
        Library Management System
    Contribute to Open Source: Collaborate on Java-based projects on GitHub
    Build Full-fledged Applications: Web apps with Spring Boot, REST APIs, etc.

Total Estimated Time: 6-9 months

Key Points to Keep in Mind:

    #Practice coding daily to improve problem-solving skills.
    Learn algorithms and data structures, which are essential for Java programming.
    Work on small projects to solidify your understanding of concepts.
